### Turing Summer Interns Training 2018

**Title**: Collaborative Working with Git and GitHub

**Facilitator**: [Kirstie Whitaker](https://github.com/KirstieJane)

**Abstract**: The session will discuss broadly why reproducible research is important, but also focus on [GitHub](https://github.com/), a free and open source platform that can help you build projects that are collaborative, well documented, and version-controlled. These are all attributes of a very successful Data Science summer enterprise! 

Kirstie will introduce you to the GitHub ecosystem, explain the common (and somewhat jargon-y) terms, and outline a couple of basic GitHub workflows. Some of you will know this already, for others it will be very new. During the 2 hour workshop you will work together to learn from each other how to navigate the [Alan Turing Institute organisation](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute) and submit and merge a pull request. We will discuss the importance of collaborative and reproducible working, and set you up for success during your internship. This is fantastic opportunity for you to discover a new way to manage research and, even for those of you already familiar with GitHub, is something that will benefit you moving forward in your careers.

**Date**: 3rd July 2017

**Location**: Turing 2nd floor space

### Turing Summer Interns Training 2017

**Title**: Collaborative Working with Git and GitHub

**Facilitator**: [Kirstie Whitaker](https://github.com/KirstieJane)

**Abstract**: [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a free and open source platform that can help you build projects that are collaborative, well documented, and version-controlled. These are all attributes of a very successful Data Science summer enterprise! In the afternoon workshop I will introduce you to the GitHub ecosystem, explain the common (and somewhat jargon-y) terms, and outline a couple of basic GitHub workflows. You will leave with your own [repository](https://help.github.com/articles/about-repositories/) within the [Alan Turing Institute](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/) organisation and having submitted and merged your first [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). You will also have [cloned](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your cloud based repository to your own computer so you can easily version control your work with [git](https://git-scm.com/). We will discuss the importance of collaborative and reproducible working, and set you up for success during your internship.
